    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancakes are a type of flatbread made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder. They are cooked on a griddle or frying pan and are often served with syrup, butter, or fruit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
        <li>Fresh fruit, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Whipped cream, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Nuts, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using).</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup and your choice of toppings.</li>
    </ol>
